		<p class="h2 pt-4">Maya Snow Study - Warm Meshers</p>
		<p class="text-justify">
            Another project I worked on in Maya was try to create a small scene based on the promotional photo
            of the virtual YouTuber unit Meshers. The scene I had in mind was to have cozy snow bunnies snuggling
            together by a mug and surrounded by a warm scarf. This is all based on the elements from each member of
            Meshers. One of the main goals of this project was to figure out how to create a snow texture.
            As I was researching how to create snow in Maya, I was looking for a method that would be less intensive
            on my laptop. My laptop does not necessarily have the right kind of power to render very intensive things,
            so this was key in my search.
        </p>

        <div class="container text-center">
            <img class="descr-img img-fluid" src="images/meshers ref.png" alt="...">
            <p class="text-justify fst-italic pt-2">
                Reference photo pointing out the bunny, scarf, and mug elements that I wanted to incorprate
            </p>
        </div>

        <p class="text-justify">
            The first thing I decided to handle was to create the mug. Once I had the mug model, I had to apply textures, 
            and in the reference photo, it shows that the mug has a particular logo. I extracted the logo from the reference
            and created a vector from it using Photoshop. I then took the UV map of the logo and added in the logo vector.
            It took a few attempts to get the positioning of the logo to be right, but eventually I had it where I wanted it to be.
        </p>

        <div class="container text-center">
            <div class="container-md">
                <img class="img-fluid" src="images/warm meshers - cup logo.png" alt="...">
            </div>
            <p class="text-justify fst-italic pt-2">
                Applying the mug logo on the UV map of the mug model
            </p>
        </div>

        <p class="text-justify">
            The tutorial that I followed showed how to make snow using aiNoise and adjusting the subsurface attribute of the material.
            aiNoise was used to create a bump map for the material to give texture similar to snow. Additionally, I had to adjust the subsurface
            attribute since snow is a solid that still allows some light to pass through. Doing this along with adjusting the specularity would 
            allow for specks of light to catch along the surface. I tested out different settings for the aiNoise as well as the specularity.
        </p>

        <div class="container text-center">
            <img class="descr-img img-fluid" src="images/warm meshers - close up.png" alt="...">
            <p class="text-justify fst-italic pt-2">
                A close up on the snow bunny
            </p>
        </div>

        <p class="text-justify">
            I liked the effect of the snow that I ended up with. However, I felt like there was something lacking about the snow bunny. 
            I figured that the surface of the bunny was still too smooth. It does not give off the feeling that it is made from real snow.
            This would require an additional texture that would slightly change the surface of the bunny model. By doing this, it would 
            give a more natural look for a bunny made out of snow. 
        </p>

        <p class="text-justify">
            When I get the chance, I would like to continue working on this to test out other methods to see what would give me results
            that I think would fit the look I was going for. Additionally, this piece is still missing the scarf that surrounds the bunnies
            and the mug. This would require another physics simulation to model the scarf a little easier. And as with each Maya project that I work on, I continue to learn new things 
            about the program. This allowed me to study how to simulate semi-realistic snow.
