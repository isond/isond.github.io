		<p class="h2 pt-4">Maya First Project - Pink Posse</p>
		<p class="text-justify">
            This was my very first personal project working with Maya. 
            In hindsight, I believe I was too ambitious for my skill level, which was a total beginner. 
            However, I think I learned a lot about using the program during this time.
        </p>

        <p class="text-justify">
            This project originally started off with me trying to model Ramuda's speakers. 
            I thought this was a good place to start since they have a relatively simple design.
            After I had the model completed, it was time to add color and textures to it.
            This was before I was aware of using texture maps and so I used the Ramp Shader to color the speakers. 
            I struggled to get the correct placement of the gradient, but I eventually found a way that I was satisfied with.
            This would've been a lot easier if I used texture maps because I can place the gradient in the exact place 
            that I wanted with using Photoshop rather than struggling to find the Selected Color Position.
        </p>

        <p class="text-justify">
            After completing the speaker model, I wanted to extend the idea and create a small animation with it. 
            I wanted to create a scene that would showcase Ramuda and his speakers, 
            and so I created a small stage for him with his group name in the back along with his MC name.
            I had trouble with trying to recreate the Fling Posse motif which is used as Ramuda's stage and decorattion for the walls. 
            The original is more rounded on the inside, but I did not know how to do that at the time, and so I resorted to just creating 
            a flattened cube and had rectangles intersecting it. 
        </p>

        <p class="text-justify">
            As for the wall decorations, I originally wanted to use images, but I struggled using them.
            There was some trouble with importing the Fling Posse logo into the scene.
            I still was unaware of texture mapping and so I resorted to adding 3D text.
        </p>

        <p class="text-justify">
            After all that, I finally got to animating the piece. 
            I wanted to have the speakers move in a playful way to reflect Ramuda's playful personality.
            I had two ideas for the animation: (1) have the speakers move up and down in a row or 
            (2) have the speakers circle around Ramuda and have them spiral around him. The second option would 
            probably make for a more interesting animation, but I decided to go with the first option since I think
            it better showcased the overall scene.
            This gave me the opportunity to learn about animating in Maya with keyframes and how to time the different objects.
        </p>

        <p class="text-justify">
            Once the speaker animation was completed, I inserted a Ramuda image to bring the whole piece together.
            However, I wanted to do a little bit more with the scene since it felt a little static to me.
            I decided to animate the Ramuda image and add some pop-up text. 
            I timed the pop-up text with Ramuda's animation to make it look like he was saying those words.
            By adding these new elements, I learned more about timing multiple animated elements in a scene. 
            Ramuda and the pop-up text have different animations and timings compared to the speakers.
            In hindsight, I should've added the image and the text using a video editting program because the additional elements
            added on to the rendering time.
        </p>

        <p class="text-justify">
            I would like to do a recreate of this piece whenever I get the chance.
            After learning to use Maya a little more after this project, I would like to implement techniques that probably would've made my life a lot easier at the time.
            However, I'm still satisfied with how the final piece came out.
