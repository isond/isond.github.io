		<p class="h2 pt-4">Personal Portfolio</p>
		<p class="text-justify">
            For my User Interaction Software class, we were required to create a personal portfolio. 
            The assignment was open-ended meaning we could include whatever works we wanted and we had freedom 
            on how to design the website. However, we were required to make it responsive so that it would adapt 
            to various screen dimensions.
        </p>

        <p class="text-justify">
            My portfolio was built using HTML and CSS as well as Bootstrap to deal with the responsiveness. 
            The portfolio section of my website showcased my projects from hackathons and classes and it also 
            showcased personal works I made using Photoshop. 
        </p>

        <p class="text-justify">
            Each project was shown as a Bootstrap card that had a preview image of the project, a short description, 
            and a button that would allow the use to view the project in full. Depending on the project, the button 
            would either lead to the appropriate website where it was located or have a modal pop up to show the 
            full image of the work. 
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
            I also wanted to include a fixed side bar on the left side of the website. There would be an icon image 
            at the top with my name and below that was the navigation. At the very bottom of the sidebar were links 
            to other websites where people could find me.
            When viewing this on mobile the sidebar would become a navigation menu at the top of the page. However, 
            the links to find me on other websites would become a footer when on mobile. 
        </p>
