		<p class="h2 pt-4">Maya Light Study - ZOOL MV</p>
		<p class="text-justify">
            Another project that I worked on in Maya was a scene recreation from ZOOL's music video. 
            Ever since I watched this video, the moving lights scene was one of the few scenes that really stood out to me,
            so I wanted to try my hand at figuring out how it could've been done.
            This also gave me a chance to further explore how Arnold Lights in Maya worked.
        </p>

        <p class="text-justify">
            The first step I did was to set up the scene, and so I created a long hallway by stretching out a cube.
            I then placed the camera on one of the ends of the hallway. I had to setup the camera at a certain height to
            make sure that when I had the lights, they would appear like a square all the way through the hallway.
        </p>

        <p class="text-justify">
            I had a few ideas on how to approach in recreating the lighting from the scene. 
            The first approach was to use spotlights. I noticed in the video that the lights had a rounded effect to it.
            I figured that I could place two point lights at each corner with each of the lights facing the opposite corner. 
            THe rounded effect was almost there but this method didn't yield the results I wanted. 
            I could not get the lights to be as bright as the ones in the reference. 
            Another problem with using only spotlights was that I was unable to get the distinct square outline that the video had.
        </p>

        <p class="text-justify">
            The second approach came about by accident I would say. I was experimenting other types of lighting in Maya, 
            one of them being area lights. Initially, I had the area lights angled at the corners in hopes of getting 
            the rounded effect. However, I misplaced one of those lights and it had become parallel to the hallway. 
            One of the sides of the light was clipping through the wall and when I rendered a preview, it created a 
            straight line of lighting similar to the music video. After this incident, I decided on using area lights. 
            I began looking into how to make the lights brighter and sharper. I was very picky about trying to make 
            the lights brighter while maintaining very dark shadows. I tried adjustng the size of the area light 
            as well as the intensity. Also, I tested out various settings for the light sampling, but I learned that 
            more samples affect how long it takes to render a scene, which proved somewhat difficult for my old laptop.  
            In the end, the setting for the lights I settled for appears slightly more diffused making a larger portion 
            of the hallway being illuminated unlike the music video where the light diffusion is more contained.
        </p>

        <p class="text-justify">
            One of the last few things I added to the scene was the models of the King Pudding mascot.
            I decided to use these as placeholders in place of the ZOOL members from the music video. 
            My skill isn't at the level where I can model them in 3D yet. Since this was a scene recreation
            I had to represent them somehow. My solution was to have a King Pudding mascot for each member
            and have the King Pudding's hair/sauce be colored the same as ZOOL.
        </p>

        <p class="text-justify">
            After that, I placed the King Puddings in the scene. I had each of them stand on a pedestal of varying
            heights to match how ZOOL has standing in the video. Each pedestal was placed a certain distance from each other. 
            In the original scene, the light passing through would reveal each member at different intervals. 
        </p>

        <div class="container text-center">
            <img class="descr-img img-fluid" src="images/zool-king-pudding.png" alt="...">
            <p class="text-justify fst-italic pt-2">
                King Pudding models on pedestals
            </p>
        </div>

        <p class="text-justify">
            The final part of this project was to get the lights to flash similarly to the music video.
            I had to adjust the timing of the lights to create the strobe effect. The lights only flash
            in the beginning of the animation, and then afterwards, they just move down the hallway.
        </p>

        <p class="text-justify">
            There are a few areas that I'd like to fix if I were to return to this piece. 
            Overall, I'm satisfied with how the final piece came out. 
            I still have lots to learn about Arnold Lights but I think this was a fun little study.
