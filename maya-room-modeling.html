		<p class="h2 pt-4">Maya Project - Kuzuha Room Model (In Progress)</p>
		<p class="text-justify">
            From the few Maya projects I've worked on, I found myself really enjoying creating 3D models from 2D images.
            The next project that I started to work on was recreating virtual YouTuber Kuzuha's room in Maya.
            Aside from personally liking the overall style of the room, I liked the tiny details that could be found in each corner.
            And so, I was curious how this room would look in 3D.
        </p>

        <div class="container text-center">
            <img class="descr-img img-fluid" src="images/kuzuha room - details.png" alt="...">
            <p class="text-justify fst-italic pt-2">
                Room details from Kuzuha's illustrator
                <!-- <br>
                Click to view full image. -->
            </p>
        </div>

        <p class="text-justify">
            I first setup the walls and floor based on the room layout as well as the main reference photo. 
            Then, I placed basic shapes to mark out the placement of the furniture using the top view layout.
            After this, I decided to find where I would like to place the camera. 
            I wanted the room to be viewed from the same angle as the main reference photo.
            Once I was satisfied where the camera was, I began to model the furniture and decorations.
        </p>

        <div class="container text-center">
            <img class="descr-img img-fluid" src="images/kuzuha room - layout.png" alt="...">
            <p class="text-justify fst-italic pt-2">
                Room layout from the top view
            </p>
        </div>

        <p class="text-justify">
            I decided to take care of the simple items in the room. For example, the shelf in the back of the room,
            the frames on the wall, the small trashcan, the clock, the hanging shelf under the clock, and 
            the computer desk. Following those, I worked on items that had a bit more detail to them. This included the 
            coffee table, the glass shelf, the items on the glass shelf, and the hanging grid rack on the wall. 
            The next items I modeled were the television and the computer monitors. At this point, 
            I started paying more attention to the proportion and angles of television and the monitors from the 
            perspective of the camera. The reason is that the television blocks a portion of computer desk area and 
            only two out of three monitors could be seen. I wanted this model to look as close as possible to the original 
            photo, but whenever I made adjustments, something would feel off about the look of it. Eventually,
            I had to settle on adjusting the television and computer monitors in a way that made sense in a 3D perspective, 
            slightly deviating from the reference photo.
        </p>

        <p class="text-justify">
            One of the biggest hurdles in this project was the tufted couch which sits in the center of the room.
            Thankfully, it was only the back portion of the couch that is tufted while the rest of it was relatively smooth.
            This one definitely required me to watch a tutorial on how to create the tufted pattern, 
            and surprisingly, it was not as difficult as I had expected it to be. After creating that, I applied a deform to it
            so that it would curve similarly to how it appears in the reference. Having the couch in the center of the room 
            felt like it really brought the piece together. 
        </p>

        <p class="text-justify">
            This project also gave the opportunity to work with the physics part of Maya. This helped me to create the curtains
            and the couch pillow. For the curtains, I created a plane that had a lot of divisions. 
            Since I want the curtains to scrunch up, I need more geometry to allow for the plane to bend better. Then, 
            I applied an nCloth on to the plane. After I created a horizontal cylinder that the cloth will attach to 
            and had it intersect with the cloth mesh. I then made the cylinder a passive collider which will allow the cloth 
            to react to it. I attached the cloth to the cylinder by applied an nConstraint to the cloth vertices 
            that intersected with the cylinder along with the cylinder itself, making the top part of the cloth stay in place. 
            Following that, I keyframed the current state of the cylinder. On another frame, I scaled the cylinder down horizontally 
            so that it became narrower and keyframed that new state. I played the animation to see the dynamics of the curtains working. 
            The curtains moved with the cylinder as it scaled down, making the curtains scrunch up. 
            It took a few attemps to get the curtains to look the way I wanted it to.
        </p>
                        
        <p class="text-justify">
            For the couch pillow, I created a general pillow shape with a cube, makign sure to have enough horizontal divisions. 
            I used nCloth once again, generating a nucleus along with it. I changed the gravity of the nucleus to 0 so
            that the pillow will stay in place once the dynamics start working. Under the attributes for nCloth, I changed the pressure
            which would essentially allow the pillow poof or fluff up, giving it that pillow quality. The lower the pressure the less 
            billowy pillow will look, the higher the pressure the softer and squisher it will look. I kept a relatively lower pressure 
            for the pillow because in the reference, the couch pillow appears somewhat flat. 
            After, I then manipulated the mesh to create wrinkles and indents to make it look a little more realistic.
        </p>

        <p class="text-justify">
            The gaming chair became my biggest hurdle right after the couch. As you can see in the render preview above, the chair is not
            present in the scene since it is incomplete. Although a small portion of the chair can be seen in the reference, I wanted 
            to try my hand at trying to model the entire thing. The gaming chair has such a distinct shape compared to all the furniture
            I have worked on which still have that general cube shape. So far, I have researched for references and have the basic 
            placement of the set and the back part of the chair.
        </p>

        <p class="text-justify">
            Overall, I found this project really enjoyable even though there were a few moments where I was frustrated with modeling.
            But it was worth the frustration since I learned about several modeling techniques during the process. 
            There is still quite a few items to add to the scene, such as the gaming chair, the plants, the shoes,
            the ceiling lights, and the other smaller items. However, I am satisfied with what I have so far, 
            so I hope that one day I get to finish the entire piece.
